        <h2>Study Timer</h2>
        <h3>Inspirations</h3>
        <p>
            Ever since highschool, I had a diverse range of interests. I would want to learn quantum physics and neurobiology, 
            python and organic chemistry. With a limited amount of time and unlimited curiosity, I did research into metacognition and 
            pedagogical techniques with the hopes of finding techniques to increase my learning efficiency. Through extensive research, 
            I found the Pomodoro technique, where the student studies for 25 minutes and takes a 5 minute break. When I personally tried 
            this method, I found that studying for 45 minutes and taking a 15 minute break improved my productivity significantly. 
            <br><br>
            As a fan of fiction, I wanted a timer that would incorporate fictional aspects into it, however the study timers that I found 
            online did not meet my requirements, so I took it upon myself to build a timer that would allow me to use the Pomodoro technique 
            while providing a touch of inspiration from the fictional characters who motivate me.

      <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
          The website has an interface made of several drop down menus. The left-most menu controls the theme. When the theme is set, it changes 
          the colours, background, and notification sound. The second menu controls the duration at which the study and break timers are configured 
          to. The final menu controls whether the user is taking a break or studying. 
          <br><br>
          A volume control also exists with a slider. This controls the notification sound that plays when the timer stops playing. This sound can be 
          changed based on the system sound, so that it is not too loud or too soft. The tab name shows the timer, so that the user can have a quick 
          view of how much time they have left.

        If the timer has piqued your interest, and you wanted to use it, the link is provided below. If you have any improvement suggestions, or any 
        characters/themes you would like me to implement, then please feel free to email me (provided below).

      <h3>Blockers & Breakthroughs</h3>

        <p>
          The design of the website was more challenging than my 
          <a href="../portfolio-site/portfolio-site.html">previous web development project</a>. 
          This project required the use of JavaScript, however this was not too difficult to learn as I have a background in python. 
          The Javascript file was quite long and filled with a lot of variables and EventListeners, which was sometimes a bit overwhelming, 
          but commenting and sectioning everything based on its functionality helped resolve this. 
        </p>

      <p>
          The biggest issue faced with this project was 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep", target="_blank">scope creep</a>. 
          As I started building the project, there was more and more I wanted to do. For example, I wanted to add a feature where users could sign 
          in and view statistics on how much they studied and how they were progressing. I wanted to show these statistics through graphs so that the 
          user could understand how they spent their time and how they could improve. I wanted to add a feature where users could add their own 
          images and sounds so that they can make the timer more personalised to them. As I went down this rabbit hole, I realised that there was only so 
          much time I could spend on this project before it was time to move on. Scope creep was a very interesting blocker for me, because I initially 
          did not consider it to be a blocker. It has taught me that sometimes curiosity has to be boxed in order for better things to come.
