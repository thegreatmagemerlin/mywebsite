                <h2>Bin Day</h2>
                <p>
                    Bin day is an original creation of mine that serves as my first official app. The app 
                    is a small app that serves a real need. Every Tuesday, when my family has to put the bins 
                    out, we have to walk to the road to check what bin we put out this week, then come back with 
                    the bins. Using this app, we can check what bin we need to keep out just from our phones.
                    <br><br>
                    The reason I chose this as my first app idea, was because the app itself was easy to 
                    implement; the users simply select their bins and with simple math the colours alternate. 
                    Even with it's simplicity however, it teaches how to create a basic app, use cloud storage, 
                    and taught me how to upload apps to the play store. As a result I was able to become confident 
                    in my abilities before tackling larger projects.

                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Flutter, which is a mobile app development platform created by 
                    google. It uses a programming language called Dart. Flutter was easy enough to learn after 
                    learning HTML as the nested Widget structure of Flutter is very similar to that of HTML, and 
                    the styling using things such as padding are the same in both HTML and Flutter. I think it is 
                    possible to learn Flutter by itself, but as someone who tried that, I think there is a lower 
                    learning curve when learning flutter after doing some web development.  <br><br>

                    Something that might stunt beginners is how to use Firebase, which is basically cloud storage 
                    offered by Google. I found it really hard because a lot of the content was outdated and caused 
                    problems. For example some tutorials did not tell me to initialise firebase in my main file 
                    and Firebase doesn't work without it. YouTube videos by

                    helped a lot. <br><br>
                    
                    The thing that held me back the most was not being able to back up my code on GitHub. I was 
                    using a font package that was really large, and it didn't let me back up my code. While trying 
                    to bundle the app to publish it on the store, my code got messed up and I essentially had to 
                    restard the app. Luckily I still had the code so it wasn't too bad, but wasted a lot of time. 
                    I got rid of the font pack and backed all the code on GitHub so now it's all safe.
