        <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
        <h3>Inspirations</h3>
        <p>
          The website that you are currently on is a personal project that I have been working on. I wanted a 
          space where I could present my projects to people interested, and I wanted a means by which I could 
          share my learnings and teachings to others. 
        </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <section class="image-paragraph">
        <p>
          I wanted to create a lightweight and fast website, without relying on any bulky frameworks. The website 
          follows a dark theme utilising CSS variables for a global colour system. Keeping the user interface in mind, 
          the website is made interactive for mobile and tablet users, however it is primarily for desktop and laptop users. 
          <br><br>
          The website starts at the homepage, from which users can access the projects and blog page. The project page contains 
          information regarding different projects. Each project can be opened up for a detailed explanation of what went into 
          the project, any inspirations, and any issues that arised. The blog has a similar layout to the project page. 
          <br><br>
          The file tree on the right shows the general layout of the project. Initially, a single CSS file was used, however with 
          the addition of several other pages, the CSS file became too large and challenging to debug, so separate CSS files were 
          used. The HTML pages and images are put into files based on their functionality and division. This allows for a more streamlined 
          file tree without too much clutter

        <h3>Blockers & Breakthroughs</h3>
        <p>
          The design of the website was quite straightforward. The initial learning of the basic 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc" target="_blank">HTML, CSS and JavaScript</a>
          was learnt through YouTube. Other than understanding how the different coding languages combine together, there wasn't anything 
          that povided much of a challenge.
