        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my website. This is the medium through which I share my personal philosophies,
          projects, and blogs. I hope you're able to take something from it, whether it's entertainment,
          learning, or a deeper understanding of a concept. <br>I genuinely hope you enjoy your stay and leave having
          learned something new.
        </p>

        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a biomedical engineering student at Monash University. I work on several personal projects that are either inspired 
          by others, or by my own personal interests/needs. I work as a private tutor, helping students with their understanding. I 
          have been blessed with being able to understand maths and science well, so I believe it is my duty to impart that knowledge 
          onto others. I hope that my efforts help in raising the next generation to be bright and intelligent. 
          <br><br>
          Outside academics, I am a Kyokushin fighter. For those of you unaware of 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maiQ2SzSJnM&t=44s&ab_channel=kyokushinbul" target="_blank">Kyokushin</a>
          , its a brutal, full contact, Japanese martial art. Through the teachings of my instructor 
          <a href="https://www.azumadojo.com/", target="_blank">Ryuichi Azuma Sensei</a>
          , I was able to secure 
          the state championship for my rank and weight. Kyokushin has built discipline and perseverance for me like nothing else.  
          I am also a gymrat, and have been in the gym from when I was in highschool. I train for my sport, but also for 
          hypertrophy. Exercise improves not only your health physically, but also mentally. I have found that exercise helps put me 
          in a better mood, and even helps me cognitively. 
          <br><br>
          I am also avid fan of fiction. My passion for science stems from the shows that I used to watch as a kid. Watching shows 
          like STAR WARS made me wish for a world like that (without the mass murdering of planets, of course). Watching Iron Man and 
          Spiderman made me want to be a better person and pushed me to learn more about STEM to hopefully be like them one day. I am also 
          a fan of anime and manga, where stories follow the protagonist who does not buckle when faced against struggles. It truly depicts 
          the indomitable human spirit when put against the indifferent cruelty of the world. 
          <br><br>
          At the end of the day, whether I'm in the lab, the dojo, or lost in a fictional world, I just want to keep learning, 
          keep building, and help make life a little better, for myself and for others.
