          Thank you for visiting my website. This is the space where I share my personal philosophies,
          projects, and experiences. I hope you're able to take something from it â€” whether it's entertainment,
          learning, or a deeper understanding of a concept. <br>I genuinely hope you enjoy your stay and leave having
          learned something new.
        </p>

        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a biomedical engineering student at Monash University. I work on several personal projects that are either inspired 
          by others, or by my own personal interests/needs. I work as a private tutor, helping students with their understanding. I 
          have been blessed with being able to understand maths and science well, so I believe it is my duty to impart that knowledge 
          onto others. I hope that my efforts help in raising the next generation to be bright and intelligent. 
          <br><br>
          Outside academics, I am a Kyokushin fighter. For those of you unaware of 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maiQ2SzSJnM&t=44s&ab_channel=kyokushinbul" target="_blank">Kyokushin</a>
          , its a brutal, full contact, Japanese martial art. Through the teachings of my instructor Ryuichi Azuma Sensei, I was able to secure 
          the state championship for my rank and weight. Kyokushin has taught me a lot about myself, and has built discipline and perseverance 
          like nothing else. I am also a gymrat, and have been in the gym from when I was in highschool. I train for my sport, but also for 
          hypertrophy.
