    <h1>Hey guys, Barath here!</h1>
    <p>I'm an engineering student at Monash university studying biomedical engineering. I'm currently in my 4th year of university.</p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>When I'm not trying to learn how biomedical devices work, I spend my time learning new things in fields such as physics, biology and chemistry. As someone who has always been interested in STEM subjects, I think everyone should have some basic understanding of how things work to have a better life. Everything around you involves science, from the device you are reading this on to the way your food is grown.</p>

    <p>Imagine going to 3300 BCE when they were writing on stone tablets and showing them your phone, they would have thought you were a God!</p>

    <h2>Physical</h2>
    <p>Studying and learning is good because it helps improve the mind, however strengthening the body is just as important as strengthening the mind, for your body is the vessel through which you pass through life. If you do not maintain it, then your journey might come to an end sooner than you would like.</p>
    <p>Fitness teaches you that you cannot achieve your dreams in a single day, but that you cannot achieve your dreams unless you work for them every single day. I don't think it matters what you do, it should be something that you enjoy and work out. I started doing a lot of different things like badminton, squash, bodybuilding, running, swimming and a few more. What I realised is that committing to several sports means that you are not a master at anything. I personally would rather be a master of one than a mediocre in several.</p>
