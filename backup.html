                <p class="intro">Hey guys, Barath here! <br><br> 
                    I'm an engineering student at Monash university studying biomedical engineering. 
                    I'm currently in my 4th semester of university.   <br><br></p>
                    <h2>Learning</h2><p>
                        When I'm not trying to learn how biomedical devices work, I spend my time learning new things in fields
                        such as physics, biology and chemistry. As someone who has always been interested in STEM subjects, I 
                        think everyone should have some basic understanding of how things work to have a better life. Everything
                        around you involves science, from the device you are reading this on to the way your food is grown. 
                        <br><br>
                        Arthur C. Clarke, a famour science fiction writer claimed "any sufficiently advanced technology is 
                        indistinguishable from magic", and when you think about it that makes a lot of sense. Imagine going to 
                        3300 BCE when they were writing on stone tablets and showing them your phone, they would have thought you 
                        were a God!
                        <br><br> 
                    <h2>Physical</h2><p>
                        Studying and learning is good because it helps improve the mind, however strengthening the body is just
                        as important as strengthening the mind, for your body is the vessel through which you pass through life.  
                        If you do not maintain it, then your journey might come to an end sooner than you would like. 
                        <br><br>
                        Fitness teaches you that you cannot achieve your dreams in a single day, but that you cannot achieve 
                        your dreams unless you work for them every single day. I don't think it matters what you do, it should 
                        be something that you enjoy and work out. I started doing a lot of different things like badminton, 
                        squash, bodybuilding, running, swimming and a few more. What I realised is that committing to several 
                        sports means that you are not a master at anything. I personally would rather be a master of one than 
                        a mediocre in several.
